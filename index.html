<h1>ICC WORLD TEST CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL</h1>
    <h4>Description</h4>
    <P>
        India and New Zealand qualified for the final as the top two teams in the league stage of the 2019–2021 ICC World Test Championship. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and multiple series being postponed, the league standings were determined by percentage of points earned.On 2 February 2021, Australia postponed their away series against South Africa, resulting in a guaranteed berth in the final for New Zealand.[5][6] On 6 March 2021, India also confirmed their berth for the final, after beating England by 3–1 in a home Test series.
        The final was initially due to be held at Lord's, but on 10 March 2021 the International Cricket Council (ICC) confirmed that the game had been moved to Rose Bowl as the ground's on-site hotels made the venue suitable to establish a bubble environment, made necessary by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.England had used the ground for some of their international fixtures in 2020.

    <h4>About the Ground</h4>
    <P>
        The Rose Bowl, known for sponsorship reasons as Ageas Bowl and also the Hampshire Bowl for the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup,[2] is a cricket ground and hotel complex in West End, in the Borough of Eastleigh, Hampshire, England, between the M27 motorway and Telegraph Woods. It is the home of Hampshire County Cricket Club, who have played there since 2001.
        It was constructed as a replacement for the County Ground in Southampton and also the United Services Recreation Ground in Portsmouth, which had both been Hampshire's homes since 1882. Hampshire played their first first-class match at the ground against Worcestershire on 9–11 May 2001, with Hampshire winning by 124 runs. The ground has since hosted international cricket, including One Day Internationals, matches in the 2004 Champions Trophy, two Twenty20 Internationals and Test matches in 2011, 2014 and 2018, when England played Sri Lanka and India. In 2020, the ground was used as one of two biosecure venues, alongside Old Trafford, for the tours involving West Indies, Pakistan and Ireland which were regulated due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
